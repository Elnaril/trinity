During Beam Sync, Trinity now collects account data that is not touched by
active blocks. We often call this "state backfill".
Storage and Bytecode backfill are not yet included, but will be shortly.
Obtaining the full state is the best way to make sure that your node cannot be
knocked offline with a Denial-of-Service attack that accesses a bunch of state
in a series of blocks.
