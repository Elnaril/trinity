Only return unique trie nodes in NodeData responses to peers. Before this fix, Trinity<->Trinity
connections where one sends a GetNodeData with duplicate hashes would cause the receiving end to
never get the response. (it failed a validation check, and couldn't be certain the response was even
intended for the given request)
